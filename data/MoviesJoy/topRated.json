The show reflects the summit of development of Danish television drama by the public service station Danmarks Radio and is just one of the favorite and very most famous examples of Danish television.\n\nThe show has become part of its mix of melodrama and a warm Danish humor at the depiction of characters , partially as a result of this modern self-understanding of all Danes, that were depicted by a large selection of the popular celebrities at the time.  But also not because of its portrayal of a turbulent Denmark from the beginning of the Great Depression and through Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark in World War II.",

The series was both visually and intellectually appealing to viewers because it showed enough muscle and brawn, had complex but real fight scenes, was funny, and had touching moments of sadness and humanity. Critics especially liked how director Kwak Jung-hwan used a Red One camera to make each shot look like it belonged in a movie theater. The hit show was at the top of the ratings chart for seven weeks in a row, with an average of 31.7 percent and a peak of 35.9 percent. Both the Seoul International Drama Awards and the KBS Drama Awards gave the show an award. Jang was also nominated for an International Emmy Award in 2011 for best actor for his role.",

        "description": "The Upside Down Show is a program that starred Shane Dundas and David Collins and was nominated for a Logie Award. It is broadcast on Noggin, Nick Jr. Australia, and ABC Australia. In the program, they play brothers who share an odd mansion that features a wide array of offbeat rooms. They live there together. The highly acclaimed Sesame Workshop was responsible for the creation of all 13 episodes of the show, which debuted on Nick Jr. Australia in August 2006 and on Noggin in the United States on October 16, 2006. Only on Noggin can you find the Sesame Workshop emblem that's been utilized for this particular show. The initial reactions of viewers to The Upside Down Show were underwhelming because the show did not live up to the standards set by Play With Me Sesame and Caillou during the 2006-2007 television season. The debut of the show received criticism for being too similar to the format of Ernie and Bert. Shane Dundas voiced his reservations regarding the continuation of the show for a second season in an interview with the New York Post that was published on December 27, 2006. The Umbilical Brothers revealed on their website on June 1st, 2007, that Nickelodeon and Noggin USA have no interest in producing a third season of The Upside Down Show, despite the show's popularity at the time. Both a Parents' Choice Award Silver Honor for Television and a Creative Craft Daytime Emmy Award for Main Title Design were bestowed for the program in the same year (2007).",

However, both these devilishly handsome angels have a problem: Wang Yeo has amnesia and Kim Shin wants to end his own (immortal) life. Unfortunately for goblins, the only way to defeat immortality is to marry a human bride. For that purpose, Kim Shin decides to win over Ji Eun Tak an optimistic high school girl who he thinks will be the priestess that ends his cursed existence. Now, once responsible for protecting souls and watching them pass, Kim Shin now tries to send his own to the afterlife. But when a slightly complicated method of suicide starts turning into true love, will our immortal goblin begin to regret his decision--where acting on that very love ultimately means the end of his life?",

Manufactured by Hartswood Films for the BBC, the show centres on the dating and sexual adventures and mishaps of six friends in their twenties, frequently depicting the 3 women and the 3 men each talking among themselves about the exact events, but in entirely different terms.\n\nThe show had been inspired by Moffat's relationship to the extent that they gave up their names, with producer Sue Vertue.  Coupling is a good example of this\"group-genre\", an outfit show that'd shown popular at the moment.  The show was compared by critics to the American sitcoms Friends and Seinfeld.\n\nThe critical reaction was largely positive, and the show was named\"Best TV Comedy\" at the 2003 British Comedy Awards.  The show debuted to unimpressive evaluations, but its popularity increased and in the united kingdom the show had achieved decent evaluations at the conclusion of this third show.  The show began airing on PBS channels and on BBC America in the United States and quickly gained a passionate fanbase that there also.  The show is syndicated all over the planet.  Greek adaptations and short-lived American were manufactured in 2003 and 2007 .",

        "description": "Klovn is a Danish sitcom that was first shown on TV2 Zulu in Denmark. It's mostly about Frank and Casper, the two main characters. The comedy in the show comes from quiet everyday situations, social awkwardness, uncomfortable silences, and general faux pas. Klovn has a lot in common with the American sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm by Larry David, especially the main idea of a semi-retired comedian and his wife, friends, and celebrities who know him getting into funny or embarrassing situations. The show is also done in a fake-realistic way that might make a first-time viewer wonder if it is real or not. Even the music is the same. Even so, the show's end credits say that Casper Christensen and Frank Hvam came up with the idea on their own. There are 60 episodes of the sitcom, spread out over 6 seasons. Each episode is 25 minutes long. The sixth and, supposedly, final season aired from February 23 to April 27, 2009. On December 16, 2010, the movie Klown came out, which was based on the series but had a different story.",
